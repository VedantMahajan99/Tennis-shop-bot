# Tennis-shop-bot

In this project i have created a retrieval-based chatbot which will deal with customers of a tennis shop.

Retrieval-based chatbots are used in closed-domain scenarios and rely on a collection of predefined responses to a user message. A retrieval-based bot completes three main tasks: intent classification, entity recognition, and response selection.
* Intent classification : using Bag of words model , TF-IDF model
* Entity recognition : using POS tagging and words embedding model

Libraries used: 

spacy : spaCy is a package that enables us to view and use pre-trained word embedding models (Word embeddings are vector representations of a word, where words with similar contexts are represented with vectors that are closer together)
* Word2Vec is a shallow neural network model that can build word embeddings using either continuous bag-of-words or continuous skip-grams

NLTK (Natural Language tool kit) : Used to process human language data. Following processes use this library
* Text preprocessing is all about cleaning and prepping text data so that itâ€™s ready for other NLP tasks.
* Noise removal is a text preprocessing step concerned with removing unnecessary formatting from our text.
* Tokenization is a text preprocessing step devoted to breaking up text into smaller units (usually words or discrete terms).
